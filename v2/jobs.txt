Note that the "url" and "apply_url" are urls into the web application. Using the API, they would be "https://<pipeline_domain>/api/v2/jobs/:id" and "https://<pipeline_domain>/api/v2/jobs/:id/apply" respectively.

The field "requires_ats_apply" denotes whether an application to this job must occur outside of pipeline. If "true", then an application can only be performed by the user in a web browser at the "url" address.

The field "has_details" denotes whether the details for the job may be fetched. Attempts to fetch details for jobs where "has_details" is "false" will return 404.

Jobs returned can be locally available jobs from Pipeline or returned via web service from an aggregator, such as Indeed. A single response can return a mixture of results.
